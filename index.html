      <h1>Avengers</h1>
      <p>
        Though primarily affiliated with the interests of the United States of
        America, the group's purpose was to protect global stability from inner
        or extraterrestrial threats. The Avengers were first assembled by
        S.H.I.E.L.D. as a result of the Avengers Initiative, when Loki invaded
        Earth with his Chitauri army.

          <h3>Iron Man</h3>
          <p>
            Iron Man gets his superpowers from his metallic suit of armor and
            other technologies invented by his alter ego Tony Stark. Tony is a
            genius engineer and wealthy owner of a technology company. Tony
            built the Iron Man suit when he was kidnapped and suffered an injury
            to his heart.

        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Thor</h3>
          <p>
            He is the mightiest. He was able to lift a planet, knock Thanos back
            yards with one punch, hold back the Hulk with one hand, nearly
            killed the Beyonder with just his brute strength, etc. Godlike
            speed: Thor can move beyond warp speed.He tried everything he could
            to make his trusty hammer work properly but it just wouldn't happen
            for him.

        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Captain America</h3>
          <p>
            Captain America has no superhuman powers, although as a result of
            the Super-Soldier Serum and "Vita-Ray" treatment, he is transformed
            from a frail young man into a "perfect" specimen of human
            development and conditioning.After being infused with the
            Super-Soldier serum, Steve Roger's body reached the upper-most
            limits of human perfection in strength, stamina, agility, and
            durability.

              'Avengers: Endgame' is a meditation on time – and it leaves us
              with a fittingly age-old message: that we should cherish the
              moments we have on this earth with our loved ones. As Tony Stark
              puts it, quoting his father to his father, “No amount of money
              ever bought a second of time. It has that same intense
              preoccupation with time, there’s long scenes where people are just
              hanging out, and there are a whole bunch of startlingly likable
              jocks.”

              "Now with “Avengers: Endgame” concluding the saga — at least for
              now — we know that it can be about everything from friendships to
              political debates and issues of representation, all while saving
              the world, of course. We asked five people who cover pop culture
              for The Times — Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, chief film critics;
              Wesley Morris, critic at large; Kyle Buchanan, pop culture
              reporter; and Aisha Harris, assistant TV editor — about the M.C.U.
              legacy and how it’s changed Hollywood and us."
